                      An RGA (Returned Goods Authorization) number is simply a
                      way for us to track return transactions. When you request
                      a return, we will process your request and issue you an
                      RGA number (if applicable) with your return instructions.
                      This information will be sent to you by email. No returns
                      will be accepted without an RGA number.
